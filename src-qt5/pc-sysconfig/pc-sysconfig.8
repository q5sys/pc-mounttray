The available action commands available to you are

This will mount the removable device on the system 
(with user-accessible permissions if the mountpoint 
needs to be created)
.Pp
If there is no filesystem set (or "auto" is 
used), it will try to use the one that is 
auto-detected for the device

new mountpoint within the "/media/" directory based on 
the device label
.It \fBunmount <device or mountpoint> [force]\fR
This will unmount the removable device from the system
.Pp
This may be forced by using the "force" flag as 
well (this is never recommended but may be required in the case that 
hald is pinging the device and keeping it marked as active.)

If the input device is a memory disk (/dev/md*), then 
it will automatically remove the memory disk from the 
system as well
.It \fBmountnet <IP of remote host> <Name of remote host>\fR
This will setup the remote host to be browsable on the 
local system with the given name
